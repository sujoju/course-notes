\begin{defBox}{Separated by a Continuous Function}[def:33_separated]
    If \( A \) and \( B \) are two subsets of the topological space \( X \), and if
    there is a continuous function \( f: X \rightarrow [ 0, 1 ] \) such that 
    \( f ( A ) = \{ 0 \} \) and \( f ( B ) = \{ 1 \} \), we say that \( A \) and 
    \( B \) \textbf{can be separated by a continuous function}.
\end{defBox}

\begin{defBox}{Completely Regular}[def:33_completely_regular]
    A space \( X \) is \textbf{completely regular} if one-point sets are closed
    (i.e. \( T_{ 1 } \)) in \( X \) and if for each point \( x_{ 0 } \) and each 
    closed set \( A \) not containing \( x_{ 0 } \), there is a continuous function
    \( f: X \rightarrow [ 0, 1 ] \) such that \( f ( x_{ 0 } ) = 1 \) and 
    \( f ( A ) = \{ 0 \} \).
\end{defBox}

\begin{defBox}{Well-Ordered}[def:10_well_ordered]
    A set \( A \) with an order relation \( < \) is said to be \textbf{well-ordered} if
    every nonempty subset of \( A \) has a smallest element.
