\begin{remarkBox}{Inverse Images and Products}
    Let \( \{ X_{ i } \}_{ i \in I } \) be an indexed set of topological spaces
    and \( X = \prod_{ i \in I } X_{ i } \).
    For any collection of subsets \( \{ U_{ i } \}_{ i \in I } \) in \( X \),
    we have
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
            \bigcap_{ i \in I } \mathrm{proj}_{ i }^{ -1 } ( U_{ i } )
            &=
            \{ \mathbf{x} \in X \mid \mathrm{proj}_{ i } ( \mathbf{x} ) \in 
            U_{ i } \text{ for all } i \in I \}
            \\
            &=
            \{ \mathbf{x} \in X \mid x_{ i } \in U_{ i } \text{ for all } 
            i \in I \}
            =
            \prod_{ i \in I } U_{ i }
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation*}

\begin{remarkBox}{On [\hyperlink{thm:19.1}{Theorem 19.1}]}
    For finite products, we see that both the box and product topologies are
    exactly the same.
    Also, we have that the [\hyperlink{15_box_top}{Box Topology}] is by 
    definition \textbf{at least as fine} as the product topology.
\end{remarkBox}

\begin{remarkBox}{Convention}
    Whenever we consider the product \( X = \prod_{ i \in I } X_{ i } \), we 
    shall assume it is given the product topology unless we specifically 
    state otherwise.
\end{remarkBox}

\begin{remarkBox}{Topologies on Arbitrary Products}
    On an arbitrary product, the natural candidate for a basis (i.e., the basis
    for the box topology) yields a topology that is sadly not suitable when discussing convergence of sequences.

    \baseSkip

    We instead have an alternative topology (i.e., the product topology for 
    arbitrary products) that is designed so convergence 
    works as expected; it can be naturally derived to avoid "infinitely
    shrinking" products of open sets.
