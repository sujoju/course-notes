\begin{qBox}{1}
    Prove that the set of all open balls with rational radius and centered at 
    points in \( \mathbb{R}^{ n } \) with rational coordinates is a basis for a 
    topology on \( \mathbb{R}^{ n } \) and that the topology it generates is the
    standard topology.

    To show that such a set is a basis, we first need to show that for each 
    \( x \in \mathbb{R}^{ n } \), there is at least one open ball with rational 
    radius centered at points in \( \mathbb{R}^{ n } \) with rational 
    coordinates.

    This follows from the fact that \( \mathbb{Q} \) is dense in \( \mathbb{R} 
    \)
