\section{Learning Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What does it mean for a space to be locally compact? 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item What are the equivalent definitions of local compactness and how do 
                they relate to each other?
                [\hyperlink{thm:29.2}{Theorem 29.2}]
        \end{itemize}
    \item What is a one-point compactification of a topological space \( X \)?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item When can we say that such a one-point compactification exists?
                [\hyperlink{cor:29.4}{Corollary 29.4}]
            \item Are these one-point compactifications Hausdorff? 
                [\hyperlink{thm:29.1}{Theorem 29.1}]
        \end{itemize}
    \item Are closed or open subspaces of a locally compact space also locally compact?
        How about for when the larger space is locally compact Hausdorff?
\end{itemize}
