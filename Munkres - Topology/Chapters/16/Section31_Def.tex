\begin{defBox}{Regular and Normal Sets}[def:31_regular_normal_sets]
    Suppose that one-point sets are closed in \( X \) -- that is, suppose that
    \( X \) is \( T_{ 1 } \).
    Then \( X \) is said to be \textbf{regular} if for each pair consisting
    of a point \( x \) and a closed set \( B \) disjoint from \( x \), there
    exists disjoint open sets containing \( x \) and \( B \), respectively.

    \baseSkip

    The space \( X \) is said to be \textbf{normal} if for each pair \( A, B \)
    of disjoint closed sets of \( X \), there exists disjoint open sets 
    containing \( A \) and \( B \), respectively.

\begin{defBox}{Closed Neighborhood}[def:31_closed_neighborhood]
    A \textbf{closed neighborhood} is a closed set that contains an open 
    neighborhood.
