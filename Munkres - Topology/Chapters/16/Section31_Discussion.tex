\begin{remarkBox}{On [\hyperlink{thm:31.2}{Theorem 31.2 }]}
    Notice that there is no analogous theorem for normal spaces.
    This is because we see that we are not guaranteed that a closed subset in
    \( Y \) will be closed in \( X \) -- meaning that we cannot utilize the 
    normality of \( X \).
    Now if \( Y \) were given to be a closed subset of \( X \) itself, then an 
    analogous theorem would exist as a result.

\begin{remarkBox}{}
    We will use the countability and separation axioms to show that certain
    spaces are metric spaces, which are very strong spaces to work with.
\end{remarkBox}

\begin{remarkBox}{On [\hyperlink{thm:31.2}{Theorem 31.2}]}
    We have that this theorem holds for arbitrary products of Hausdorff or
    regular spaces.
