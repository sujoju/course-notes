\begin{defBox}{Linear Continuum}[def:24_linear_continuum]
    A simply ordered set \( L \) having more than one element is called a 
    \textbf{linear continuum} if the following hold:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \( L \) has the least upper bound property
        \item It \( x < y \), there exists \( z \) such that \( x < z < y \).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{defBox}

\begin{defBox}{Path and Path-Connected}[def:24_path_connected]
    Given points \( x \) and \( y \) of the space \( X \), a \textbf{path} in 
    \( X \) from \( x \) to \( y \) is a continuous map 
    \( \gamma: [ a, b ] \rightarrow X \) of some closed interval \( [ a, b ]
    \subset \mathbb{R} \) with the subspace topology into \( X \),
    such that \( \gamma ( a ) = x \) and \( \gamma ( b ) = y \).

    \baseSkip

    A space \( X \) is said to be \textbf{path connected} if every pair of 
    points of \( X \) can be joined by a path in \( X \).
