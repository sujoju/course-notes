\section{Learning Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What is a path?
    \item What does it mean for a space to be path-connected?
    \item Is a path-connected space always connected? What about the converse?
        [\hyperlink{thm:24.5}{Theorem 24.5}] 
    \item Is the image of a path-connected space always path-connected? 
        [\hyperlink{thm:24.6}{Lemma 24.6}]
    \item If a space \( X \) is either connected or path-connected, then can be 
        say that a homeomorphic space \( Y \) is either connected, or 
        path-connected as well? [\hyperlink{thm:24.7}{Theorem 24.7}]
