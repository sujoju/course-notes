\begin{itemize}
    \item What does it mean for a space to be first-countable?
        Second-countable?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item What is the difference between the two?
        \end{itemize}
    \item What does it mean for a subset to be dense?
    \item What does it mean for a space to be Lindel\"{o}f?

            \item What is the difference between Lindel\"{o}f and second-countable?
        \end{itemize}
    \item What does it mean for a space to be separable?
    \item Does a space being second-countable imply that it is Lindel\"{o}f?
        Separable?
        [\hyperlink{thm:30.3}{Theorem 30.3}]
    \item What condition on the space \( X \) do we need in order for the following 
        to be equivalent?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \( X \) is second-countable
            \item \( X \) is separable
            \item \( X \) is Lindel\"{o}f
        \end{enumerate}
        Why is the condition necessary? 
        [\hyperlink{thm:30.4}{Extension of Theorem 30.3}].
