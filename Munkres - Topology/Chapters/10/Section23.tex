\section{Learning Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What are the equivalent definitions of connected sets?
    \item How does connectedness apply for subspaces? 
        [\hyperlink{lem:23.1}{Lemma 23.1}]
    \item How do connected subspaces behave when its larger space has a 
        separation? [\hyperlink{lem:23.2}{Lemma 23.2}]
    \item How do unions of connected sets behave?
        [\hyperlink{thm:23.3}{Theorem 23.3}]
    \item Why can we say that the closure a connected set is connected?
        [\hyperlink{thm:23.4}{Theorem 23.4}]
    \item Is the image of a connected space always connected? 
        [\hyperlink{thm:23.5}{Lemma 23.5}]
    \item Is a finite product of connected spaces connected? How about  
        arbitrary products? [\hyperlink{thm:23.6}{Theorem 23.6}]
