\begin{remarkBox}{On Connectedness}
    We can see that connectedness is a topological property since it is 
    formulated entirely in terms of the collection of open sets of \( X \).
    Said differently, we have that if \( X \) is connected, then so is 
    any space homeomorphic to \( X \).

\begin{remarkBox}{More Examples}
    More examples can be found in \S 23 of Munkres.
