\begin{defBox}{Separation and Connected}[def:23_separation_connected]
    Let \( X \) be a topological space.
    A \textbf{separation} of \( X \) is a pair \( U, V \) of disjoint
    non-empty open subsets of \( X \) whose union is \( X \).
    The space \( X \) is said to be \textbf{connected} if there \textit{does 
    not} exists a separation of \( X \).
