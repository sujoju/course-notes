\section{Learning Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What is a basis for a topology?
    \item What does it mean for a topology to be generated by a basis?
    \item What are some common examples of topologies on \( \mathbb{R} \)?
    \item What is subbasis and the topology that it generates?
    \item Why can we express every open set in a topological space as a union
        of basis elements? [\hyperlink{lem:13.1}{Lemma 13.1}]
    \item How can we obtain a basis for a given topology?
        [\hyperlink{lem:13.2}{Lemma 13.2}]
    \item How can we determine if topologies are finer than each other via 
        bases? [\hyperlink{lem:13.3}{Lemma 13.3}]
    \item What are the three common topologies on \( \mathbb{R} \), and what 
        do their corresponding bases consist of? 
        [\hyperlink{def:13_R_top}{Topologies on \( \mathbb{R} \)}]
