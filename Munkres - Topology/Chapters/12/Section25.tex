\section{Learning Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What are connected components?
    \item What are path-components?
    \item How do connected components divide up a space?
        [\hyperlink{thm:25.1}{Theorem 25.1}]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Can we say the same thing for path-components?
                [\hyperlink{thm:25.2}{Theorem 25.2}]
        \end{itemize}
    \item What is the equivalent definition of locally connected spaces?
        [\hyperlink{thm:25.3}{Theorem 25.3}]
    \item What is the equivalent definition of locally path-connected spaces?
        [\hyperlink{thm:25.4}{Theorem 25.4}]
    \item Do all path components lie in a component? When do path components 
        coincide with components? [\hyperlink{thm:25.5}{Theorem 25.5}]
\end{itemize}
