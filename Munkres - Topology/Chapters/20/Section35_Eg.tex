\begin{egBox}{Continuous Extension}[eg:35-1]
    Let \( A = [ 1, \infty ) \) and \( X = \mathbb{R} \). 
    Let \( f: A \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) be defined by \( f ( x ) = \frac{ 1 }{ x } \).
    We are able to make a continuous extension of \( f \) to all of \( \mathbb{R} \)
    by just glueing on another continuous function to \( f \).

    Let's now consider the slightly altered: \( A = ( 0, \infty ) \)
    and \( X = \mathbb{R} \). 
    Let \( f: A \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) be defined by \( f ( x ) = \frac{ 1 }{ x } \).
    We can see in this case that there does not exist a continuous extension of 
    \( f \) -- our function diverges at \( 0 \), and there is no way that we can 
    "glue" on another continuous function to make an extension of \( f \) continuous.
