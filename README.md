# Course Notes
This repository contains all the course notes that I have taken during my time at 
Northwestern. All of these course notes have been written by me, and they are 
mainly composed up of definitions, worked-out examples, and theorems (along with 
their proofs). Currently, I have the following course notes available:

- Munkres Topology (MATH 344-1)

My plan is to eventually type up and work through my old course notes in hopes that 
I can make clear the many connections that each course has with each other.
